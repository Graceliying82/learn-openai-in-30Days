Prompts:

Prompt Templates:
The objects that take user input and transform it into the final string or messages are known as "Prompt Templates"

PromptValue:
ChatModels and LLMs take different input types. PromptValue is a class designed to be interoperable between the two.
It exposes a method to be cast to a string (to work with LLMs) and another to be cast to a list of messages (to work with ChatModels).

PromptTemplate types:
MessagePromptTemplate:
HumanMessagePromptTemplate: This is MessagePromptTemplate that produces a HumanMessage.
AIMessagePromptTemplate: This is MessagePromptTemplate that produces an AIMessage.
SystemMessagePromptTemplate: This is MessagePromptTemplate that produces a SystemMessage.

MessagesPlaceholder:
Oftentimes inputs to prompts can be a list of messages. This is when you would use a MessagesPlaceholder.
These objects are parameterized by a variable_name argument.

ChatPromptTemplate:
This consists of a list of MessagePromptTemplates or MessagePlaceholders.
These are then formatted with user inputs to produce a final list of messages.
