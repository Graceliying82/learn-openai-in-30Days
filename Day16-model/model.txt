LLMs
LLMs in LangChain refer to pure text completion models. The APIs they wrap take a string prompt as input and output a string completion.
OpenAI's GPT-3 is implemented as an LLM.

Chat Models
Chat models are often backed by LLMs but tuned specifically for having conversations.
Crucially, their provider APIs use a different interface than pure text completion models.
Instead of a single string, they take a list of chat messages as input and they return an AI message as output.
See the section below for more details on what exactly a message consists of.
GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude-2 are both implemented as chat models.
