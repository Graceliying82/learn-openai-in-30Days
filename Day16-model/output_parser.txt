Output Parser Types

The output of models are either strings or a message. Oftentimes, the string or messages contains information
formatted in a specific format to be used downstream (e.g. a comma separated list, or JSON blob).
Output parsers are responsible for taking in the output of a model and transforming it into a more usable form.
These generally work on the content of the output message, but occasionally work on values in the additional_kwargs field.

StrOutputParser:
This is a simple output parser that just converts the output of a language model (LLM or ChatModel) into a string

OpenAI Functions Parsers:
There are a few parsers dedicated to working with OpenAI function calling.

Agent Output Parsers:
Agents are systems that use language models to determine what steps to take.
The output of a language model therefore needs to be parsed into some schema that can represent what actions (if any)
are to be taken. AgentOutputParsers are responsible for taking raw LLM or ChatModel output and converting it to that
schema. The logic inside these output parsers can differ depending on the model and prompting strategy being used.
