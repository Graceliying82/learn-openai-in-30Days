I am trying to find a way to make my PDF_Chat using Pinecone database.

1. Watched a video: Pinecone x Hugging Face Workshop: Inference Endpoints
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78VIBB9ZaR0

2. This is the link tell you how to use pinecone with hugging Face
https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/hugging-face-endpoints
It will need to use Inference Endpoints which will cost 0.06/hour. I feel it's not what I need for now. But may come back later if I need this service.

3. Watch this video and trying to see what I can do to my project.
